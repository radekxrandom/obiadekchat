- **Adding new contacts with a Search ID**

  - To copy it users can click it or the icon next to it. Navigation with tab works too.
  - After finding someone's profile a friend request can be send.
  - This request can be either accepted or declined.
- **Adding new contacts with a URL**
  - Users can also add contacts by sharing a specially generated URL with them.
  - Each URL can be used only once.
  - It can be shared with friends who already use the website or with completely new users.

## üíπ &nbsp; Technologies

> Project is created with:

#### Server

- Express
- Mongoose
- JWT Tokens for authentication
- bcryptjs for one way password hashing
- socket.io for real-time, bidirectional, event based communication between client and server. Oh and also for having a level of abstraction over managing WebSockets, long polling, etc.
- mocha

#### Client

- React JS
- Redux (although I am moving away from it)
- Redux Thunk
- Axios
- rsuite (although I am moving away from it because of bad a11y support)
- Hybrid Crypto JS
- WDYR for help with optimization in development mode

## üí° &nbsp; Future goals

- Full a11y compliance. As of now only the Starting page is easily navigated with keyboard and has 100% correct aria labels.
- Polish localization.
- Being able to use one account on different devices.
- Better test coverage.
- Cleaner and faster code.
- Many, many other things.
